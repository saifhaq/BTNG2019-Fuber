# FaaSTrac - an "uber" for Farming Equipment

Allow investors to invest in farming equipment that can be rented out to farmers - so farmers get access to equipment they might not otherwise be able to afford.

This concept that can be applied to other things, but for our example we are looking at farming equipment.
